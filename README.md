# CSC_7343_HW1_PianoGen_F23
Repository for mini project for LSU's CSC 7343 class, Homework 1.
In this homework, the goal is to implement and train two LSTM models, one called piano music composer and the other called critic. More details can be found int the ```PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION.md``` file

From Dr. Zhang`s repo, [PianoGen](https://github.com/zhang8/PianoGen), the file "model_base.py" contains the base classes. These templates had to be used as is and the class names were required to be kept fixed. The file ```midi2seq.py``` contains a set of functions that help to process the midi data and convert the data to sequences of events.  

Got **98/100** for this submission..yaee. The ```music?``` is not really music but sounds cool though. A sample mp4 generated by the composer is provided with this repository.

## Setup

* First download the the piano data (in midi format) from: [MIDI data](https://storage.googleapis.com/magentadata/datasets/maestro/v1.0.0/maestro-v1.0.0-midi.zip) Unzip and put it in the root of this project directory. Don't change the name of the unzipped folder

* Install these dependencies. I used an Anaconda enviornment with Mamba package manager
  * torch, torchvision and cuda
  * scikit-learn
  * googledrivedownloader

* Clone my fork of ```pretty_midi``` that contains a fix for compatiblity with Numpy>=1.20.0 and install it locally in edit mode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mechazo11/pretty-midi.git
pip3 install -e ./pretty-midi
```

## Usage

Open and run the ```all_tasks_driver.ipynb``` notebook to train the two LSTMS and test performance of composer against critc.
